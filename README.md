# ADHD-Helper todoist

I ll keep it short for now:

I want to create a simple todo list on the web for people with ADHD that struggle with execution dysfunction.
The way i d like this to work is basically that you can create lists for things that you need or want to do.
You can star them and other typical todo list stuff but here for each item on the list we connect it to an AI Agent who will then take the task
and plan out subtasks for it.
You mark your tasks by importance where they get put on a seperate list on which you ll see the main tasks goal but on the todo you have the actual first subtasks to start the journey

I ve always struggled with this so i m trying to create this for me in the first place and if it has value i d like to make an actual product out of it with a free version. Not sure about this yet
